# Faraday-cage-Rampage

js13KGames entry for 2018. Theme: Offline

A bullet hell game about a hermit disrupting telecommunication system antennas.

Destroy drones with the energy you accumulate on your Tin Foil Hat, collect 10 scraps to build faraday cages around each antenna and get 'em all offline!

All art work was done pixel by pixel using a text-editor, mapping each character to a color.
